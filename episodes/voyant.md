## Introduction to Voyant

[Voyant](https://voyant-tools.org/) is a simple, powerful and user-friendly open-source reading and analysis environment for digital texts founded by St√©fan Sinclair and now maintaned by Geoffrey Rockwell, Andrew MacDonald and Cecily Raynor at the Universities of McGill and Alberta in Canada. It is browser-based and allows you to upload documents or copy and paste text directly into its interface, which Voyant then automatically analyses according to some core Natural Language Processing (NLP) principles.

Voyant is a useful tool for those new to NLP because its landing 'Dashboard' site provides an instant, synchronic and customisable overview of many facets of the corpus uploaded while keeping the workings 'under the hood'. This allows you to dive straight into exploring the linguistic features of your corpus intuitively, without getting bogged down in the linear, incremental coding workflow of NLP libraries such as the Natural Language Toolkit, spaCy or Flair. In other words, Voyant does not require any prior programming knowledge and enables inductive, corpus-driven observations to be made, which can lead you to refine your research questions and then move on to using other tools in a more targeted way.

::::: keypoints  

1. The Voyant website allows you to dive into your corpus right away by uploading a document or several to its server.  
2. Most of Voyant's dashboard tools such as Cirrus, Termsberry and Contexts, rely on token frequency counts and collocations.  
3. These types of tools can yield insights into the lexical diversity of the corpus, which terms in a given corpus are most or least prominent, and the other words with which they frequently appear. This can highlight patterns or trends that can then be further analysed with other tools.
