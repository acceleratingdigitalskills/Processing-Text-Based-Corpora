:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions 

- What is corpus linguistics?
- What can I do using corpus linguistic analysis tools?
- How does this method differ from 'analogue' 'close reading' methods in musicology?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

- define what constitutes a corpus and a sublanguage
- define key concepts relating to textual analysis e.g. type and token, lemmatization, collocation, n-gram, etc.
- identify affordances and constraints of a frequency-based approach to discourse analysis

::::::::: keypoints

- Corpus linguistics is study of language as part of a “body” of text, wherein language appears in its “natural” context.

- Corpus studies involve the compilation and analysis of collections of text (i.e. the body) which afford insights into the nature, structure, and use of language in this context. 

- Corpus methods can be used to investigate the underlying patterns and contextual associations of words in a body of text, amongst other uses. This is what is known as a 'distant reading' approach to texts, focused on identifying patterns across large datasets.
