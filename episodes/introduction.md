::::::::: keypoints

1. Corpus linguistics is study of language as part of a body of text, wherein language appears in its "natural" context.
2. Corpus studies involve the compilation and analysis of collections of text (i.e. the body) which afford insights into the nature, structure, and use of language in this context.
3. Natural language processing (NLP) is a field that formulates techniques for understanding contexts and rules of language function.
4. Corpus methods can be used to determine the underlying patterns and contextual associations of words and phrases in a body of text, amongst other uses. This is known as a "distant reading" approach to texts, focused on identifying and quantifying patterns across large datasets.
5. The insights yielded from NLP approaches to text can supplement more traditional techniques of (critical) discourse analysis.
