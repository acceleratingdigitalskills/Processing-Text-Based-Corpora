:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions 

- What are word embeddings and what are they for?
- How can I create embeddings using spaCy?
- How can I visualise the results?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

- Understand the principles behind word embeddings.
- Use Python, spaCy and Pandas to create word embeddings for a corpus of musical terms.
- Use Google TensorFlow's Embedding Projector tool to visualise and interpet results.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

The dataset for this episode, containing terms from Boomkat's 'Grime / FWD' and 'Industrial / Wave / Electro' subgenre corpora, can be accessed via the ['Episode 5' Zenodo repository](https://zenodo.org/records/10931458).


:::::::::::::::::discussion

In breakout rooms of pairs or groups of three, go to the website for Google TensorFlow's [Embedding Projector Tool](https://projector.tensorflow.org/) and load the grime_industrial_embedding data and metadata files. Play around with the settings and the projection and use the Etherpad to write down questions and observations to share with the whole group.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::hint

Use the 'Color By' function to differentiate terms by genre. This will assign a different colour to Grime versus Industrial terms and allow you to visually identify semantic themes that are more prevalent in one or the other genre.

Enable the 3D labels mode to see the terms themselves rather than points.
